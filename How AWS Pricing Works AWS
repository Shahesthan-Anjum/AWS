AWS has the services to help you build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability and reliability.
Whether you're looking for compute power, database storage, content delivery, or otherfunctionality, with AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, 
for as long as you use them,without complex licensing. AWS offers you a variety of pricing models for over 160 cloud services.
You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.

###There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer.
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same Region. There are some exceptions, 
so be sure to verify data transfer rates before beginning. Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate.
This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out. The more data you transfer, the less you pay per GB. For compute resources,
you pay hourly from the time you launch a resource until the time you terminate it, unless you have made a reservation for which the cost is agreed upon beforehand. 
For data storage and transfer, you typically pay per GB.Except as otherwise noted, AWS prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and
sales tax. For customers with a Japanese billing address, use of AWS is subject to Japanese Consumption Tax.

cost optimization
The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it.
And, because of the economies of scale, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself. Whether you started in the cloud, or
you are just starting your migration journey to the cloud, AWS has a set of solutions to help you manage and optimize your spend.
This includes services, tools, and resources to organize and track cost and usage data, enhance control through consolidated billing and access permission, 
enable better planning through budgeting and forecasts, and further lower cost with resources and pricing optimizations. To learn how you can optimize
